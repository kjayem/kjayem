### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a artist from Seoul, South Korea.

For me, creating things to express my thoughts and feelings has given me one of the biggest joys in life! My favorite way of expression is through sound, which I play through music(I enjoy producing music, playing instruments, and listening to them!).

Then I use other forms of expression like coding for the visual side of things.

Anyways... I hope you enjoy looking around my github page!
